def text_editors
  "Text editors allow you to type out your code and it highlights the text as you go along.  IDEs or integrated development environments are a little different.  They are text editors that compile and debug your code.  Basically it takes what you type in the text editor section and shows you what that equals on the console side. You will have access to multiple text editors and IDEs throughout this site."
end

def register
  "You can register and save the code you practice while going through the lessons.  Your saved code is only available to you.  Feel free to take notes that will help you remember and review the code in the notes section.  If you ever need to go over what you have already done or just want to keep a code reference, you will have access to it as long as you can access your account."
